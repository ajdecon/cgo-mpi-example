Trivial example - MPI in Go
==========================

I think Go's cgo interface to C is pretty awesome, so I decided to investigate
whether I could get MPI working. Amazingly enough, it works! :) At least for 
the simple examples I've tried.

Note that other people have started work on full wrapper libraries for Go 
-- such as [marcusthierfelder/mpi](https://github.com/marcusthierfelder/mpi) --
I just wanted to mess around with cgo a bit myself.

Code was written and tested on OS X with OpenMPI 1.4.5. The cgo directives
in each file include the arguments generated by

```
$ mpicc --showme:compile
$ mpicc --showme:link
```

And the paths generated are OS X specific; you'll want to change them if 
working on a different system.
